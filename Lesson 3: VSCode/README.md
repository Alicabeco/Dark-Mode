When viewing a project, this is the main window that you will be in 99% of the time.  Here we have a project open (this particular project is a basic react application), and sectioned pieces to break it down.

In Pink, we have the open editors.  Here all of the different files that you have open in your project will appear.  Deleting a tab will just close the editor, not the file.  By selecting on each tab, you can navigate between different files.  Only editors that you open, will appear here.

In yellow, we have the open editor.  This is where you are working on your code for your program.  In this window, syntax highlighting is taken care of by VS code.  Errors and warnings will appear as tabs on the right hand side next to the overall project view.  This allows for quick navigation to edit large files and helps to debig your code.

In green, we have the terminal.  When a new project is open, the terminal may not be open right away.  To open the terminal, use the keyboard shortcut of (control + shift + backtick).  This terminal is the same as any terminal or command line you would open up on your computer and accesses the same files.

In purple, we have the file structure/layout.  This is the entire structure of your project. When you open a project, you are opening a file on your computer that acts as the top level folder for your project and anything within that folder is accessible within VSCode.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

These are the default keyboard shortcuts for VSCode.  Learning them will allow you to create code fast and efficiently.  To change them, go into VS code preferences and keyboard shortcuts.  Here you can customize any shortcuts you would like.

## Developing in VSCode

There are a few ways to get a new project started in VS code.  The two methods mentioned here are starting a new file for single files programs, and starting a new folder for multi-file programs.  The following image is what you will see when you first open VSCode and have no current projects opened (note colours may vary dependent on theme).

### Starting a project from a new file

Starting a project from a new file is good if you have a single file that needs to be edited.  This may be good for simple programs such as a "Hello World" program (as the most basic example).  Avoid this option if you will need to integrate this file into a larger project at a later time or if you would like to add github or source control integration.  For larger programs, there are more efficient ways to add a file that will cause less error.

Begin by clicking the "New File..." option from the home page of VSCode (shown above).

When prompted to enter a new name, name your file.  You may add the file extension here as well if you wish.

Next, your file manager should pop up. This will be your finder window on a mac and the file explorer on a windows.  Browse through your files to find a folder that you wish to put this newly created file in.  

Once selected, the file will either automatically open, or give a prompt asking if you would like to open it in VScode.
