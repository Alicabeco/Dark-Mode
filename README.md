# Dark Mode

Welcome to Dark Mode, an initiative by BYU IT&CSA to introduce essential topics that are necessary to do cool things. We are planning on covering the following topics (order subject to change):

1.  GitHub
2.  Linux
3.  VSCode
4.  Raspberry Pi
5.  Troubleshooting
6.  Something (Vote)
7.  Something (Vote)

Most of these topics are not covered well in class until much later in the program (if they are covered at all).

Files for these topics can be found in the relevent folder in this repository.
