# Dark Mode

Welcome to Dark Mode, an initiative by BYU IT&CSA to introduce essential topics that are necessary to do cool things. We are planning on covering the following topics (order subject to change):

## Fall 2023 Semester

1. Embedded Systems and Home Automation by Zach Thompson - October 25th, 2023
2. How to Build a Computer by Jarom Emms - November 8th, 2023
3. Carson Cubbuck - November 29th, 2023

## Winter 2024 Semester

1. TBD

Most of these topics are not covered well in class until much later in the program (if they are covered at all).

You will notice that there are a few weeks with no topic planned. We would like to take some suggested topics to talk about. We have also created a list of topics we think would be interesting, and will pull some of the topics from this list as well. We try to avoid security and networking related topics as those are already covered very well by the Cybersecurity Student Association and Network Engineering Club. If you are interested in either of those topics, we encourage you to get invloved with those organizations.

* Containerization
* Server Room/Data Center
* How to Build a Computer
* Internet of Things/Hardware Hacking

Files for these topics can be found in the relevent folder in this repository.
