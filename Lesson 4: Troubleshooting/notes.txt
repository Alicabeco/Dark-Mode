- 6 Steps To Troubleshoot 
    1. Define the Problem:  Take a look at the big picture.  What are all of the symptoms?
        Identify specific errors.  Ask helpful questions. What is the actual problem?
    2. Collect relevant information: Stack Overflow, instructions, etc. Things that will
        help understand the system.
    3. Analyze steps 1+2: Has the system changed recently?  Has it been used differently?
        If you are not finding root cause, revisit step 2.
    4. Propose a solution and test: Weigh the "cost" of each solution.  Could it potentially
        break things more?  Like if you mess with a Linux kernal without being familiar you
        could kill your computer.  Try simplest solutions first.  In sensitive situations,
        try to test your solution where it will not ruin everything if it doesn't work.  ie 
        Create a virtual machine or save a snapshot if you can.
    5. Implement the solution.
    6. Document: Especially if you are doing it for work or a personal project.
